# Welcome to my website!

I am a computer science student at RWTH Aachen. I love exploring new things
and understand best by explaining; doing so helps me verify that I have really
understood a topic. By doing this explaining in an online setting,
I hope to be able to share some of my understanding with others.

My academic interest currently focuses on Machine Learning, but really, I can
be fascinated by most things and adore the interconnectedness of knowledge domains.
